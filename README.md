Module 3 Challenge Submission 
Contributor: Cassia Yoon

I. PyBank Assignment:
    We were instructed to create a python script to analyze the financial records of a company using a csv data set (found in: PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The script I created (PyBank/main.py) uses python to read the csv file and output total number of months. It uses Pandas and data frames to calculate net total, and max/min of profits. The results are then exported into a text file (found in: PyBank/analysis/PyBank_output.txt).

II. PyPoll Assignment:
    We were instructed to use python script to analyze a csv data set (PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv) containing poll data from a small, rural town to help modernize their voting process. My script (PyPoll/main.py) uses python to read the csv file and calculate total votes, list of candidates, percentages, and winner. The script prints the results in the terminal and also exports them into a text file (PyPoll/analysis/PyPoll_output.txt).

Though I did not complete all the analyses that were assigned, I did learn a lot from the exercise. I plan on revisiting this assignment to finish the incomplete portions. I did start out working on this assignment with pandas and data frames and did not realize I was supposed to use primarily the csv module to complete the assignemnt until a few hours before it was due.

I would like to thank my instructor, TAs, and classmates for playing an important part in my learning, and my new best friend, the internet.
